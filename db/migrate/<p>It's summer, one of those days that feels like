<p>I squinted over at the clock and groaned. Sixteen more minutes before migration. It couldn&apos;t come soon enough. This time, the habitation had ended with a raucous New Year&apos;s party that lasted almost three days- starting from the obligatory gathering on December 31st, and lasting through New Year&apos;s Day, Then the next, and on into the wee hours of this morning. Say what you want, but steel workers can party. Shedding this body also meant shedding this hangover, and that wasn&apos;t a bad thing. Whoever moves in here is off to a rough start, I suppose, but nothing that can&apos;t be dealt with. Switchers are a resilient bunch.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been switching since birth. I don&apos;t know how many of us there are, but I know I&apos;m not the only one. Instinctively, we know who the others are when we see them, and we know not to tell the &quot;statics&quot; about what we are. It&apos;s something you are born with, or are not. Every year, you switch. You become someone else. Generally, the body you switch to is roughly the same age as you are chronologically, but that seems to be the only rule. My first four in a row were boys, then with the fifth one, I was introduced to a whole new set of plumbing. I have been white, black, asian, fat, skinny, a parapalegic, and pregnant twice, given birth once. I have been hosted in nineteen different countries in twenty seven years. I quit speculating on what&apos;s in store for me years ago.</p>

<p>The odd thing is, you bring your own memories with you, and acquire the memories of the host...which is, I suppose, pretty handy. You switch in to a new life, and know what you need to know to get by, for the most part. As a five year old, I knew that my mommy was named Karen, Dad was Steve, and I had three older brothers, one of whom picked on me a lot. As a nineteen year old, My boyfriend was Kevin, and I emerged with the same affection for him as my predecessor did, even though my previous switch had been as a junior college pitcher in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>This past year has been pretty interesting. I&apos;m currently a steel worker in Buffalo, New York, and have been gainfully employed for the past year. The year before that, I was a waitress in a tiki bar in Key West. Before that, a car salesman in Chicago, and before that, a floor trader at the New York Stock exchange. I&apos;ve been a surgical resident, a point guard in the Italian version of the NBA, and a stay at home mom. I spent a year as a heroin addict that ended up with me in county jail.
Would I be a male? Female? American? (That year as a Syrian Rebel kinda sucked, by the way.) I didn&apos;t know, and I didn&apos;t speculate. I only knew I&apos;d be roughly 27 years old, give or take.</p>
