<p>It's summer, one of those days that feels like walking through someone's warm, wet breath. A gross day. Jess is wandering around the fairgrounds with Barry Binninger, who's the son of his mom's friend Linda and who whines almost constantly. </p>
<p>They're walking along the row of games. Jess only has a dollar, so he has to pick something he can win. The ring toss game is bullshit. He's seen probably twenty people lose their money on it since they got here. He's pretty sure the necks of the bottles are too big to toss a ring onto, anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;This place is a total rip-off.&quot; Barry scuffs his way toward the nearest bench and plops down like a pillowcase full of sand.</p>
<p>Jess looks at the game next to him. The guy manning the booth is pretty sketchy -- red hair slicked back and a missing front tooth. He's holding a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>&quot;Wanna try your luck?&quot; the booth guys says. &quot;Winner gets the best prize at the carnival.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot; Jess says. &quot;What's that? A teddy bear that doesn't smell like shit?&quot;</p>
<p>The man cracks a smile. &quot;It's a mystery prize. Fifty cents to play.&quot;</p>
<p>Jess is pretty sure he knows what a mystery prize is, and it involves twenty years of therapy after you leave the carnival. &quot;No thanks, man.&quot; </p>
<p>He turns, and the man lurches forward and grabs his wrist. Jess turns to look at him. The man's eyes are so dilated that they're almost completely black. Jess' stomach lurches and he pulls his hand away.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the bow,&quot; the man says, and Jess swallows. His heart is suddenly pounding, and he can't say why.</p>
<p>He nods and reaches for the bow. In the background, he can hear Barry whining faintly -- &quot;hey man, don't spend all your money here&quot; -- but the words are like waves lapping softly against him. He can only focus on the bow as the man places it into his hands. </p>
<p>&quot;Aim at heaven,&quot; the man says.</p>
<p>Jess has only fired a bow in gym, and he wasn't even good at it then. But the arrow slides into place naturally. The pull of his shoulder muscle feels practiced and sure. He releases the arrow and watches as it soars up, up -- impossibly high, over the carnival tent and out of sight.</p>
<p>Adrenaline rushes out of him and he looks down at the bow. He suddenly feels like he's about to cry. It's the hollow, melancholy feeling of someone revealing the end of a book when you're halfway through. It pierces him cleanly.</p>
<p>&quot;He who would take your life,&quot; the man says, &quot;now take his.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Jess says.</p>
<p>&quot;Now take his,&quot; the man says. </p>
<p>Jess can't breathe. He gasps, a few ragged breaths. &quot;Keep the money,&quot; he says, and turns away. He stumbles toward the Ferris wheel, and then he's running, running hysterically, out into the parking lot.</p>
<p>Barry finds him bent double over a red Honda Civic, panting. &quot;Hey man, not cool,&quot; Barry says. &quot;You can't just take off like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Jess looks back at the fair. The Ferris wheel glints in the ordinary late afternoon light, and in the sky, the trace of an airplane's tail shoots northward. </p>
