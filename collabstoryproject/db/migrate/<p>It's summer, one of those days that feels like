<p><i>Clean up on deck three requested.  Clean up on deck three. </i> Gwen thumbed at her earpiece, turning off the eternally pleasant voice of the ship&rsquo;s monitoring software and signalling receipt of the message.  Deck 3 was the passenger dorms; almost certainly one of the tourists had vomited when the artificial gravity glitched out.  Gwen sighed.  &ldquo;Follow tight,&rdquo; she told her cart of tools and supplies, and with one last glance out at the stars, pushed off the wall of the viewing deck. She floated up towards the entrance, the little yellow cart following with a quiet humming at her heels. </p>

<p>
	She took the back passages of the ship, hoping to keep out of the way of people. Without the grav system, passengers would be banging into things and getting stuck on the ceilings, unused to the sudden lack of directionality.  The crew&rsquo;s tempers would be fraying, as they gave landlubbers gentle (or not so gentle) nudges in the direction they needed to go.  The head mechanic and his minions would be converging towards the engines and moderators, cursing at anyone in their way. Better to avoid it all. </p>
<p>
The halls were narrow, meant more as conduits for wiring and piping than for people.  But Gwen was small, and she knew the insides of the ship better than her own.  She shimmied past one of the monitoring bots crawling along the cables in the other direction, absently checking for the blue light that meant the bot was healthy.  </p>

<p>
	The helpless thing was flashing a sad orange, one of its legs jerking ineffectively as it tried to move. Something small and white was lodged in the joint; picking a screwdriver from the cart, Gwen pried it out and gave the bot a gentle push to get it started again. It flashed blue and moved slowly off, leaving her fingering a misplaced plastic screw.  A screw that should have been holding shut a ventilation access panel.</p>

<p>
	She glanced along the passage, searching for the nearest panel.  It was shut tightly, all screws in place.  But debris on a spaceship didn&rsquo;t appear from nowhere. Pulling a flashlight from her belt, she moved on to the next panel. Clean up on deck three, her earpiece reminded her, and she swiped it off without responding. This panel had been tampered with, empty boreholes like blind eyes along its edges.  Someone had been messing with her ship.  </p>
<p> Gwen levered the panel off, and peered in.  The flashlight reflected from two shining eyes, and someone curled up in the darkness whispered, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
